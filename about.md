I am a current undergraduate sophomore at the [University of Pennsylvania](http://www.upenn.edu/), majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Statistics. I enjoy spending my time working on interesting side projects, eating Korean food, and exploring the exciting city of Philadelphia!

I am currently working as a part time Software Engineering Intern at [Vea Life](http://www.vealife.com/), where I am primarily working on developing a watchOS companion app to round out the overall iOS experience for Vea. In addition, I am also a part of [Penn Labs](http://pennlabs.org/), a student software development team, where we develop applications used by the entire Penn student body! In the past, I have worked as both a Web Developer for [The Daily Pennsylvanian](http://www.thedp.com/), and as a technology consultant for the [Student Federal Credit Union](https://www.upennsfcu.org/). 

My primary interest involves working on products that will ultimately impact the lives of millions of individuals. I love seeing my work directly influence or change the daily lifestyle of another. Whether it be a small iOS app that goes viral or the next big webapp, I have a passion for delivering meaningful products that others will enjoy. (Self driving cars, anyone?).

Thanks again for checking out my website, and definitely [contact me](mailto:gaoj@seas.upenn.edu) if you are interested in working together!
