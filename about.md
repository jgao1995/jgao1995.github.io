I am a current junior at the [University of Pennsylvania](http://www.upenn.edu/), majoring in Computer Science and submatriculating into the Computer Graphics and Game Technology masters program. I enjoy spending my time developing impactful technologies, teaching, and improving my art skills.

Apart from being a full time student, I am currently working in the SIG Center for Computer Graphics as a research assistant, investigating novel ways to realistically simulate heterogeneous crowds, and as a teaching assistant for [CIS121 - Data Structures and Algorithms]() and [CIS196 - Ruby on Rails Web Development](), where I am responsible for developing new homeworks and grading tools in Ruby and Java, as well leading recitations. In the past, I have worked part time as a Software Engineering Intern at [Vea Fitness](http://www.vealife.com/), and as a Software Engineer for [Penn Labs](http://pennlabs.org/), a student software development team officially sponsored by Penn. I have also been involved with the [Student Federal Credit Union](https://www.upennsfcu.org/) at Penn as a technology analyst, as well as [The Daily Pennsylvania](http://www.thedp.com/) as a Web Developer.

I love seeing my work directly influence or change the lifestyle of another human being. Whether it be a small iOS app that goes viral or the next big startup idea, I have a passion for delivering meaningful products that others will enjoy. (Self driving cars, anyone?).

Thanks again for checking out my website, and definitely [contact me](mailto:gaoj@seas.upenn.edu) if you have any questions or would like to work together!
