I am a junior at the [University of Pennsylvania](http://www.upenn.edu/), pursuing and undergraduate degree in Computer Science and a masters degree in Computer Graphics and Game Technology. I enjoy spending my free time developing impactful technologies, teaching, and improving my (mediocre) art skills.

Apart from being a full time student, I am currently a research assistant at the SIG Center for Computer Graphics at Penn, investigating novel ways to realistically simulate heterogeneous crowds. I am also a teaching assistant for [CIS121 - Data Structures and Algorithms](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis121/current/staff.html) and [CIS196 - Ruby on Rails Web Development](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis196/), where I am responsible for implementing new homeworks and developing grading tools in Ruby and Java as well leading weekly recitations and holding office hours. During my sophomore year, I worked as a part time Software Engineering Intern for [Vea Fitness](http://www.vealife.com/), a Philadelphia startup looking to reward users who work our reguarly, and as a Software Engineer for [Penn Labs](http://pennlabs.org/), a student software development team officially sponsored by Penn. Finally, during my freshman year I was involved with the [Student Federal Credit Union](https://www.upennsfcu.org/) at Penn as a technology analyst, and [The Daily Pennsylvania](http://www.thedp.com/) as a Web Developer.

I love seeing my work directly influence or change the lifestyle of another human being. Whether it be a small iOS app that goes viral or the next big startup idea, I have a passion for delivering elegant products that others will use. (I am currently super exicted about the applications of VR/AR!).

Thanks again for checking out my website, and definitely [contact me](mailto:gaoj@seas.upenn.edu) if you have any questions or would like to work together!
