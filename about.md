I am a junior at the [University of Pennsylvania](http://www.upenn.edu/), pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and a masters degree in Computer Graphics and Game Technology.

In addition to being a full time student, I am currently a research assistant at the SIG Center for Computer Graphics at Penn, currently evaluating the educational applications of Google's new [Tango](https://get.google.com/tango/) Technology. I am also a teaching assistant for [CIS121 - Data Structures and Algorithms](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis121/current/staff.html) and [CIS196 - Ruby on Rails Web Development](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis196/), where I am responsible for implementing new homeworks and developing grading tools in Ruby and Java as well leading weekly recitations and holding office hours. Previously, I have worked as a part time Software Engineering Intern for [Vea Fitness](http://www.vealife.com/), a Software Engineer for [Penn Labs](http://pennlabs.org/), a technology analyst for the [Student Federal Credit Union](https://www.upennsfcu.org/), and a web developer for the [The Daily Pennsylvania](http://www.thedp.com/).

This summer, I will be in the SF bay area as a KPCB Engineering Fellow interning at Slack Technologies. Definitely [reach out](mailto:gaoj@seas.upenn.edu) if you would like to connect!
