You can find both my current and past projects listed here. While some may no longer be viewable live, you can find all of the sources on [my github](https://github.com/jgao1995)!

##Current Projects

### Barter
- An iOS app that lets you trade your unwanted items with strangers in your area. If you were to take a step into my dorm room right now, you would see an immeasurable amount of odd knick knacks that I feel are only taking up space. Perhaps I can exchange them with someone in a nearby dorm for items of value to me? In order to accomplish this, I decided to create Barter! It's simple and easy to use, like Tinder, but also modern and not ugly like Craigslist. 

### Jukebox 
- Rails app that allows users to join rooms and share music from Youtube, Soundcloud, and Spotify for everyone in the room to enjoy! The inspiration for this idea came from Soundrop, a Spotify add-on that has since been removed from Spotify's service. I used to use Soundrop a lot with my girlfriend, but after its demise we lamented the lack of an alternative service. Hence, I decided to create Jukebox! 

##Past Projects

### [Collaborate](http://collaborate-io.herokuapp.com/) 
- Rails app that lets users create campaigns and vote for their favorite ones. Complete with a recommendations system, as well as a ranking system for active campaigns. Users are allowed to comment on their favorite campaigns, and provide feedback to the owner of each campaign, to collaboratively improve each campaign. Inspired by Product Hunt and Kickstarter.
