## Current Projects

### [Procedural Pokemon](https://davlia.github.io/procedural-pokemon)
- A procedurally generated 2D pokemon world with multiplayer capability. Source [here](https://github.com/davlia/procedural-pokemon).


## Past Projects

### [Interesting Shaders](http://josephgao.me/Project5-Shaders/)

### [Mini Minecraft](https://bitbucket.org/jgao1995/cis460-minecraft)
- Final project for CIS 460: Introduction to Computer Graphics. Built using C++ and OpenGL. Repository contains a readme and images from the final result.

### [PennVolvement](http://pennvolvement.com/)
- Rails webapp that connects Penn students to local organizations in need of volunteers. Students are able to create their own organizations and post their own volunteer events as well. I lead the development of PennVolvement as a PM and lead developer in Penn Labs. The app itself has been approved by the University of Pennsylvania for use, and has been named the official student volunteer service portal for Penn students by the Penn UA. 

### [Surgery.io](https://github.com/jgao1995/Surgery.io)
- Rails webapp that allows surgeons to quickly check the compatibility between two or more endovascular surgical or neuro surgical devices. The app also enables surgeons and doctors to configure and simulate hypothetical surgical scenarios, save and share the scenarios for future reference, and comment on other doctor's posted scenarios. The app has been approved for use by the Hospital at University of Pennsylvania

### [Watchman](https://github.com/jgao1995/Watchman)
- A watchOS application that works in tandem with its iOS counterpart. Watchman allows the app to detect the immense recoil that results from a gunshot and issue a safety warning to nearby civilians and law enforcement authorities. The app utilizes the CoreMotion framework to continually record the accelerometer activity of the watch, as well as the HealthKit to monitor the officer's heartrate in BPM. The accelerometer data is cross-referenced with the heartrate data to prevent false alarm alerts. The idea was to provide police offers who have an apple watch with a tool that would allow officers provide a safer environment for civilians and officers alike, so when a potential fire-fight is breaking out, civilians will instantly know dangerous hotspots and officers with the app will be able to respond without having to wait for a dispatcher to inform them of the situation. 

### [Collaborate](http://collaborate-io.herokuapp.com/) 
- Rails app that lets users create campaigns and vote for their favorite ones. Complete with a recommendations system, as well as a ranking system for active campaigns. Users are allowed to comment on their favorite campaigns, and provide feedback to the owner of each campaign, to collaboratively improve each campaign. Inspired by Product Hunt and Kickstarter. The github repo can be found [here](https://github.com/jgao1995/Collaborate).

### [iOS Template Projects](https://github.com/jgao1995/iOS-Template-Projects)
- Some simple iOS template projects that can easily be adapted for use by anyone! The apps include: a simple location based weather query service, a Tic Tac Toe game, a To Do List, and a location tracker that uses the iPhone's GPS to track your movements on your morning run, afternoon walk, etc.

### [Humans of New York Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/jgao1995/HONY-Analysis)
- As our final project for Nets 150, my team and I decided to analyze the popular Humans of New York facebook page to investigate why some posts receive more likes than others. We measured like count against a variety of different potential variables, and were able to produce some very interesting data visualizations with Plot.ly. The results can be found on the github page, but I will create a blog post about it in the future!

### [34th Street Feature](http://jgao1995.github.io/34thStreet/)
- The feature story webpage I created for the Daily Pennsylvanian. Primariy created with HTML and CSS, with Disqus comments integration. The github repository can be found [here](https://github.com/jgao1995/34thStreet/tree/gh-pages).

### [WikiLearn](https://github.com/ryin1/wikilearn)
- A python project made at Hackprinceton Spring 2015, our team worked on a way to effectively visualize relationships between similar terms from a wikipedia query. The motivation behind the project was for a way to better understand the relationship between a search query and the outlinks on that specific query's page. Our project was honored as a top 16 hack out of over 100 teams present.

### [TextFeed](https://github.com/jgao1995/TextFeed) 
- An SMS based service that allows anyone with a cellular connection to receive location-based crime information via a simple SMS query. We were able to pull relevant information using Comcast's Everyblock API, and we handled the SMS queries with Twilio and a Flask backend. Our project was honored by Taser as the best public safety application, and received an honorable mention from Comcast for the best use of their Everyblock API.
