You can find both my current and past projects listed here. While some may no longer be viewable live, you can find all of the sources on [my github](https://github.com/jgao1995)!

##Current Projects

### [Jukebox](https://github.com/jgao1995/Jukebox)
- Rails app that allows users to join rooms and share music from Youtube, Soundcloud, and Spotify for everyone in the room to enjoy! The inspiration for this idea came from Soundrop, a Spotify add-on that has since been removed from Spotify's service. My friends and I were big fans of Soundrop, but after its demise we all were unable to find an alternative service. Hence, I decided to create Jukebox! 

### [Barter](https://github.com/jgao1995/Barter)
- An iOS app that lets you trade your unwanted items with strangers in your area. If you were to take a step into my dorm room right now, you would see an immeasurable amount of odd knick knacks that I feel are only taking up space. Perhaps I can exchange them with someone in a nearby dorm for items of value to me? In order to accomplish this, I decided to create Barter! It's simple and easy to use, like Tinder, but also modern and not ugly like Craigslist. 

##Past Projects

### [Collaborate](http://collaborate-io.herokuapp.com/) 
- Rails app that lets users create campaigns and vote for their favorite ones. Complete with a recommendations system, as well as a ranking system for active campaigns. Users are allowed to comment on their favorite campaigns, and provide feedback to the owner of each campaign, to collaboratively improve each campaign. Inspired by Product Hunt and Kickstarter. The github repo can be found [here](https://github.com/jgao1995/Collaborate).

### [iOS Template Projects](https://github.com/jgao1995/iOS-Template-Projects)
- Some simple iOS template projects that can easily be adapted for use by anyone! The apps include: a simple location based weather query service, a Tic Tac Toe game, a To Do List, and a location tracker that uses the iPhone's GPS to track your movements on your morning run, afternoon walk, etc.

### [Humans of New York Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/jgao1995/HONY-Analysis)
- As our final project for Nets 150, my team and I decided to analyze the popular Humans of New York facebook page to investigate why some posts receive more likes than others. We measured like count against a variaty of different potential variables, and were able to produce some very interesting data visualizations with Plot.ly. The results can be found on the github page, but I will create a blog post about it in the future!

### [34th Street Feature](http://jgao1995.github.io/34thStreet/)
- The feature story webpage I created for the Daily Pennsylvanian. Primariy created with HTML and CSS, with Disqus comments integration. The github repository can be found [here](https://github.com/jgao1995/34thStreet/tree/gh-pages).

### [WikiLearn](https://github.com/ryin1/wikilearn)
- A python project made at Hackprinceton Spring 2015, our team worked on a way to effectively visualize relationships between similar terms from a wikipedia query. The motivation behind the project was for a way to better understand the relationship between a search query and the outlinks on that specific query's page. Our project was honored as a top 16 hack out of over 100 teams present.

### [TextFeed](https://github.com/jgao1995/TextFeed) 
- An SMS based service that allows anyone with a cellular connection to receive location-based crime information via a simple SMS query. We were able to pull relevant information using Comcast's Everyblock API, and we handled the SMS queries with Twilio and a Flask backend. Our project was honored by Taser as the best public safety application, and received an honorable mention from Comcast for the best use of their Everyblock API.
